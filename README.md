# Kaggle-problem---House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

1. The objective of the problem is to build a predictive model on train dataset of 1460 properties. 
2. The built model is predicted on test datset to check accuracy of predictions on Kaggle.
3. The kaggle problem has been worked upon in a team of 3. Our team made it to the top 7 percentile of the rankings.
4. The best model is a stacked model based on lasso, ridge regression and gbm method.
5. As part of the project, my contribution is to test models related to 
   a. recursive partitioning decision trees
   b. neural networks
   c. random forests
   d. gradient boosting method
6. The R codes for the above models along with data pre-processing is attached. Data pre-processing includes 
   a. removal of constant variance variables
   b. data imputation using median
